## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pygame
```

### Run the Simulator
```bash
python collision_2d.py
```

## üìñ What Is This?

This simulator shows you **real physics in action**! Watch colored circles bounce around, collide with each other and walls, while live charts track the underlying physics principles that govern all motion.

### üéÆ Interactive Controls

| Key | Action | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| `SPACE` | Reset | Generate new random bodies |
| `P` | Pause | Pause/unpause the simulation |
| `T` | Trails | Toggle motion trails (see where bodies have been) |
| `V` | Vectors | Toggle velocity arrows (see speed & direction) |
| `C` | Charts | Toggle live physics data charts |
| `1` | Elastic | Perfect bouncy collisions (e=1.0) |
| `2` | Semi-Elastic | Slightly less bouncy (e=0.8) |
| `3` | Inelastic | Moderately bouncy (e=0.5) |
| `4` | Very Inelastic | Low bounce (e=0.2) |
| `ESC` | Exit | Close the simulator |

## üî¨ Physics Concepts Explained

### 1. Conservation of Momentum
**The Big Idea**: In a closed system, total momentum never changes.

```
Total Momentum = m‚ÇÅv‚ÇÅ + m‚ÇÇv‚ÇÇ + m‚ÇÉv‚ÇÉ + ...
```

**What You'll See**: The "Total Momentum" chart stays roughly flat, even during chaotic collisions!

### 2. Kinetic Energy
**The Big Idea**: Energy of motion. Unlike momentum, this *can* be lost in collisions.

```
Kinetic Energy = ¬Ωmv¬≤
```

**What You'll See**: 
- **Elastic collisions (e=1.0)**: Energy stays constant
- **Inelastic collisions (e<1.0)**: Energy decreases over time

### 3. Coefficient of Restitution (e)
**The Big Idea**: How "bouncy" a collision is.

- **e = 1.0**: Perfectly elastic (rubber ball on hard floor)
- **e = 0.8**: Somewhat elastic (basketball bounce)
- **e = 0.5**: Moderately inelastic (tennis ball on grass)
- **e = 0.2**: Highly inelastic (clay ball collision)

### 4. Impulse-Momentum Theorem
**The Big Idea**: A quick force (impulse) changes momentum instantly.

```
Impulse = Change in Momentum = Force √ó Time
```

**What You'll See**: When circles collide, they instantly change direction and speed.

## üìä Live Data Visualization

### Four Real-Time Charts

1. **üîµ Total Momentum**
   - Should stay relatively constant (conservation law!)
   - Small fluctuations are normal due to wall collisions

2. **üî¥ Kinetic Energy**
   - Flat line for elastic collisions
   - Decreasing steps for inelastic collisions
   - Shows energy being "lost" (converted to heat in real life)

3. **üü¢ Average Speed**
   - Overall "activity" level of the system
   - Decreases over time in inelastic systems

4. **üü† Collisions/Frame**
   - How many impacts are happening right now
   - Spikes during high-activity moments

## üßÆ The Mathematics Behind It

### Core Collision Formula

When two circles collide, we calculate the impulse:

```
j = -(1 + e) √ó (relative_velocity ¬∑ normal) / (1/m‚ÇÅ + 1/m‚ÇÇ)
```

Then update velocities:
```
v‚ÇÅ_new = v‚ÇÅ_old - (j/m‚ÇÅ) √ó normal
v‚ÇÇ_new = v‚ÇÇ_old + (j/m‚ÇÇ) √ó normal
```

### Vector Operations Used

- **Distance**: `d = ‚àö[(x‚ÇÇ-x‚ÇÅ)¬≤ + (y‚ÇÇ-y‚ÇÅ)¬≤]`
- **Normal Vector**: `nÃÇ = (pos‚ÇÇ - pos‚ÇÅ) / |pos‚ÇÇ - pos‚ÇÅ|`
- **Dot Product**: `a¬∑b = |a||b|cos(Œ∏)`

## üéØ Educational Experiments

### Experiment 1: Conservation Laws
1. Press `1` (elastic) and watch both momentum and energy stay constant
2. Press `3` (inelastic) and see energy decrease while momentum stays constant

### Experiment 2: Mass Effects
- Small circles bounce dramatically off large ones
- Large circles barely react to small collisions
- Mass = radius¬≤ (like constant density disks)

### Experiment 3: Energy Dissipation
1. Start with `1` (elastic) - high energy system
2. Switch to `4` (highly inelastic) - watch energy drain away
3. Bodies eventually move very slowly

### Experiment 4: Visual Analysis
- Press `T` to see motion trails
- Press `V` to see velocity vectors
- Watch how vectors change during collisions

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Key Classes

- **`Body`**: Represents a physics object with position, velocity, mass, and color
- **`World`**: Manages all bodies, handles collisions, updates physics
- **`Chart`**: Real-time data visualization for physics quantities

### Physics Pipeline (60 FPS)
1. **Move**: Update positions based on velocity
2. **Wall Collisions**: Bounce off boundaries
3. **Body Collisions**: Detect overlaps and resolve
4. **Position Correction**: Prevent objects from "sinking"
5. **Data Update**: Feed charts with current physics values

### Collision Detection
- **Broad Phase**: Check all pairs of bodies
- **Narrow Phase**: Distance-based circle overlap
- **Resolution**: Impulse-based velocity updates

## üí° Real-World Applications

### Game Development
- **Physics Engines**: Unity, Unreal Engine use similar principles
- **Particle Systems**: Explosions, debris, fluid simulation
- **Character Movement**: Bouncing, sliding, impact effects

### Education & Research
- **Interactive Learning**: Visualize abstract physics concepts
- **Scientific Simulation**: Molecular dynamics, planetary motion
- **Engineering**: Material collision analysis, safety testing

### Animation & VFX
- **Realistic Motion**: Natural-looking collisions and bounces
- **Pre-visualization**: Test physics before expensive rendering
- **Interactive Art**: Physics-based installations and games

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

Edit these values at the top of `collision_2d.py`:

```python
N_BODIES = 3              # Number of circles (recommended: 3-6)
RADIUS_RANGE = (20, 35)   # Size range of circles
SPEED_RANGE = (60, 180)   # Initial speed range
E_COEFF = 1.0             # Default elasticity
MASS_FROM_RADIUS = True   # Whether mass = radius¬≤
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Performance Issues
- **Reduce N_BODIES**: Try 3-4 bodies instead of 6+
- **Disable Charts**: Press `C` to turn off real-time graphing
- **Lower FPS**: Change `TARGET_FPS` from 60 to 30

### Physics Looks Wrong
- **Bodies stick together**: Increase `PERCENT_CORRECTION` to 0.9
- **System gains energy**: Check that `E_COEFF` ‚â§ 1.0
- **Jittery motion**: Decrease `SLOP` value to 0.005

### Visual Issues
- **Circles overlap walls**: Adjust `WALL_MARGIN`
- **Charts not showing**: Press `C` or check `SHOW_CHARTS = True`
- **Arrows too small/large**: Modify `VELOCITY_VECTOR_SCALE`
